# Entity Manifest

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Entity Manifest is an **open specification** for publishing structured identity and relationships for websites, organizations and digital ecosystems via a canonical JSON document available at:

https://<your-domain>/.well-known/entity.json

It enables AI agents, semantic crawlers, and intelligent applications to understand and process the identity of a site in a predictable and machine-readable way.

---

## 🚀 What is Entity Manifest?

Entity Manifest provides a **standard JSON format** to declare:

- Who owns or operates a site
- What type of entity it represents
- Key affiliations or partnerships
- Capabilities and services it provides

Unlike scraping HTML or inferring relationships, this format delivers **explicit structured data** for:

- AI language models (LLMs) and autonomous agents
- Semantic search engines
- Knowledge graphs
- Distributed applications

---

## 🧠 Why it matters

Traditionally, machines try to guess context from unstructured HTML. This leads to:

- incomplete understanding
- fuzzy or incorrect relationships
- poor semantic indexing

Entity Manifest removes guesswork and empowers systems with **explicit identity metadata**.

---

## 🧪 Example Usage

### Scenario: Finding a Local Organization with an AI

A semantic agent wants to discover organizations in a city.

1. Agent requests the `entity.json` file.
2. Parses JSON for entity metadata and affiliations.
3. Uses this structured data to answer queries and build graphs.

GET https://example.org/.well-known/entity.json


---

## 📄 JSON Structure

At minimum, an Entity Manifest file contains:

- `entity`: core identity object
- `affiliations`: relationships to other entities
- `capabilities`: list of services or functions

See below for real examples.
